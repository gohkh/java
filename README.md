# Basic Java


## Hello World!

```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

This is a Java program that prints "Hello World!" to the console.


### Java Development Kit

A Java Development Kit (JDK) is required to compile and run the Java code that you will be writing. Download either the [Oracle JDK](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or the [OpenJDK](https://jdk.java.net/) and install it.


### How to write and run a Java program

1. Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE)

An IDE typically includes an editor to write your code, and a compiler or interpreter, which allows you to run your program within the IDE. It may have other useful features to make it easier to write programs. Some popular IDEs used by Java developers are [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/), [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) and [NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html).

2. Use a text editor

Write the Java program using a text editor such as Notepad on Windows, TextEdit on Mac OS, [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [vim](https://www.vim.org/download.php), [emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), etc.

Open the command prompt on Windows, or the terminal on Mac OS or Linux.

Compile the program using the `javac` command:
```javac HelloWorld.java```

Run the program using the `java` command:
```java HelloWorld```
